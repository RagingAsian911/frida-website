Quick bug-fix release to address an issue in our ELF parser:

- elf-module: Fix recursion in check_str_bounds() when falling back to live
  memory. The function assumed a file-backed ELF; falling back to live memory
  could trigger unbounded recursion. An explicit live-memory check has been
  added to return an error instead.

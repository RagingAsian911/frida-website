Tiny release, big impact: these two one-liner fixes from [@mrmacete][] make sure
Interceptor behaves correctly on newer iOS versions.

- code-allocator: Use `pc` for slice address checks so `is_near` and
  `is_aligned` stay in sync even when `data` and `pc` differ, e.g. on iOS 26
  Thanks [@mrmacete][]!

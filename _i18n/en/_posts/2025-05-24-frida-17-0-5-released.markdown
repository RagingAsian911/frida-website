Quick bug-fix release to fix agents generated by the latest frida-compile.
We need to explicitly declare internal agents as ESM now that the TypeScript
compiler is more conformant and ends up generating CommonJS glue code. This
fixes our Darwin and Android agents, as well as the Barebone backend's script
runtime.

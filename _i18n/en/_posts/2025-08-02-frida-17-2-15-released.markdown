This one has been brewing for a while, and a whole bunch of goodies just
landed:

- darwin / fruity: Support iOS 26 through dual-mapping, and enable injection on
  palera1n. Massive shout-out to [@mrmacete][] for driving this effort.
- android: Bump frida-java-bridge in system-server to pick up [@AeonLucid][]’s
  ART offset-lookup improvements.
- platform: Add preliminary visionOS support. Huge thanks to [@demonguy][] for
  pioneering this brand-new frontier.
- freebsd: Bring x86 (32-bit) to the party. Hat-tip to [@saruman9][] for the
  implementation.
- threads: Wire up NEON register access on ARM/arm64 for both Linux and Darwin
  – kudos to [@londek][] for the patch-set.
- barebone: Add support for the uint type in NativeFunction / NativeCallback,
  and gracefully handle the MMU being disabled.
- buffer: Fix BufferReader.read_pointer(), where we mistakenly expected an
  offset to be passed in.

Enjoy!

Another quick bug-fix release, because software is hard! This release
addresses the following issue:

- node: Fix module resolution when not built from source. Turns out the
  `package.json` generated inside our build directory confused the module root
  detection in the `bindings` package. This means that our search path was
  actually wrong, and relied on this being misdetected.

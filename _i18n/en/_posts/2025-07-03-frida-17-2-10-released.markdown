Quick bug-fix release addressing two important issues:

- **frida-node**: Fix keep-alive ThreadSafeFunction teardown. Use
  `napi_release_threadsafe_function()` in keep-alive scenarios so that
  pending microtasks have time to run before the libuv handle is dropped.
  This prevents "unsettled top-level await" during teardown. Co-authored by
  [@as0ler][], [@hsorbo][], and [@mrmacete][].

- **barebone**: Ensure RustModule C ABI entrypoints survive garbage collection.
  Newer Rust toolchains use `--gc-sections`, which strips unused sections.
  We refactored `make_linker_script()` to scan the Rust source for symbols
  intended to be visible, and emit `KEEP(*(.text.<symbol>))` directives so
  those entrypoints are retained.

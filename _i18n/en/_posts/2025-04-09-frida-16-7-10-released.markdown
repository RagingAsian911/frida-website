We're pleased to announce Frida 16.7.10, bringing several stability
improvements. Special thanks to [@mrmacete][] for identifying the root cause of
all of them, and fixing a deadlock on Apple OSes.

The following changes are included in this release:

- **network-stack**: Fixed TcpConnection transmit logic.
- **network-stack**: Improved VirtualStream locking to enhance batching and
  avoid unnecessary scheduling on Frida's thread.
- **virtual-stream**: Allowed `update_pending_io()` to be called without holding
  a lock for convenience when a subclass doesn't need to update any other state
  before calling it. One of our subclasses was assuming this to be the case, as
  that was its behavior before the commonalities were factored out into the
  VirtualStream base-class. This means that this refactoring made in 16.7.4
  introduced a race condition, and this change fixes it.
- **darwin**: Optimized thread enumeration by avoiding flags. This eliminates
  heap allocations, reducing the risk of deadlocks in use cases like the
  Interceptor, where thread enumeration is used to suspend and resume threads
  by ID. (Contributed by [@mrmacete][].)

Enjoy!

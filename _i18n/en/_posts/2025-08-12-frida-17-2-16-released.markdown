Fresh maintenance release bringing a handful of fixes and quality-of-life
improvements across the board:

- gumjs: Ensure that `onLeave` is only invoked after its matching `onEnter`
  actually ran, eliminating unpredictable behaviour when hooks are attached
  mid-call. Thanks [@mrmacete][]!
- darwin-module: Swap-hook the `lldb_image_notifier` pointer in dyld’s “all
  image infos” to keep the module registry functional even on modern iOS
  devices where the notifier is just one instruction long. Cheers
  [@mrmacete][]!
- barebone: Add `try_remap_writable_pages()`.
- barebone: Allow overriding `query_rwx_support()` to tailor RWX capability
  probing to exotic platforms.
- frida-node: Honour `package-lock.json` during the TypeScript stage to keep the
  JS dependency tree fully deterministic.

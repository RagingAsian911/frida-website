This release brings improved support for Google's latest ART runtime on 32-bit
ARM, better error-handling on Linux, and improved support for big-endian ARM
architectures.

Here are the highlights:

- **Improved frida-java-bridge to support Google's latest 32-bit ARM binaries.**
  Thanks to [@Rwkeith][].
- **Propagated ptrace errors on failure in the Linux backend.** Thanks to
  [@DoranekoSystems][].
- **Improved support for big-endian ARM architectures (armbe8, arm64be,
  arm64beilp32).**
- **Removed redundant hardware breakpoint code in the Linux backend.**

As always, we thank our contributors for their valuable efforts in making
Frida better.

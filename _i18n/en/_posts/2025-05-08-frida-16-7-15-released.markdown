We are excited to announce a major update to our Node.js bindings! They have
been rewritten from scratch. Instead of depending on Node.js and V8 APIs that
inevitably change between releases, requiring separate builds per ABI, our
bindings now target Node-API. This means that a single binary can be used across
all modern versions of Node.js, Electron, nw.js, etc. We only need to build one
binary per OS/arch/libc combo. Not only that, but our new bindings are also
auto-generated, ensuring that API changes in frida-core are instantly reflected,
with only customizations needing tweaking if applicable.

This release also contains some other goodies:

- *DeviceManager*: Fixed crash on early `close()` in situations where
  `HostSessionService` `start()` gets cancelled.
- *Web Service*: Fixed handling of TLS connections, as the remote address
  logic did not take them into account.
- *API*: Fixed up `FridaBase` references in the `.gir` files.
- *Bus*: Removed the `device` property, which wasn't meant to be exposed.

As always, a big thank you to all contributors and users for your support.

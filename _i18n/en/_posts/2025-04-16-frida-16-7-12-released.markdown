This release brings several important improvements and fixes:

- interceptor: Avoid heap allocation during suspend. By storing the suspended
  thread IDs into a `GumMetalArray` instead of a `GQueue`, we prevent deadlocks
  when a suspended thread is holding the `dlmalloc` lock. Thanks to
  [@mrmacete][] for this improvement.
- linux: Fix `ModuleRegistry` initialization when ELF is missing. When
  enumerating RTLD notifiers and loaded modules to find a `DT_DEBUG` entry, we
  no longer assume the ELF file is present. This fixes issues when the program
  was loaded from a memfd and spawned without a file.
- elf-module: Use live memory if unable to map file. For modules backed by a
  memfd, we now utilize the in-memory ELF rather than giving up if we cannot
  map the file.
- linux: Rework glibc pthread internals detection. Instead of parsing machine
  code to determine internals, we now start threads to solve the puzzle in a
  more robust fashion.

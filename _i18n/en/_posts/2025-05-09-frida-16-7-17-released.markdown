This release brings several improvements and fixes to our Fruity backend,
enhancing compatibility and error handling across platforms. Below are the
changes included in this release:

- fruity: Initiate pairing on macOS too, if needed.
- fruity: Tweak macOS CreateAssertion error handling. So we provide a clean
  error message when it fails.
- fruity: Handle OPACK boolean and compact integers. Support for the latter is
  needed during pairing on iOS 18.4.1.
- fruity: Improve portable tunnel error-handling. When we use lockdown to
  determine if the iDevice supports tunnels, and that fails due to lack of
  lockdown-level pairing, simply assume that the OS supports it.
- fruity: Add timeout to the Linux netif wait logic.
- fruity: Handle NetworkManager DISCONNECTED+CARRIER. So we actually wait until
  the device is ready when it quickly passes through state=DISCONNECTED with
  reason=CARRIER.

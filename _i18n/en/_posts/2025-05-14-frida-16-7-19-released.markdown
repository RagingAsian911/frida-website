This release improves Linux thread enumeration under glibc and hardens our
static OpenSSL build against unintended config loading.

**Changes:**
- **linux**: Skip glibc threads with `tid = 0` (exited but unjoined) to avoid
  false “Unsupported Linux system” panics.
- **linux**: List glibc threads in creation order (oldest first) to mirror
  real thread lifecycles.
- **deps (TLS)**: Build OpenSSL with `OPENSSL_NO_AUTOLOAD_CONFIG` to block
  loading any system config file, preventing crashes when initializing TLS.

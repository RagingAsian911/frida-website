Back-to-back releases! Software is hard, and sometimes we need to push quick
fixes to keep things running smoothly. Here's what's new in this release:

- **frida-node** Fixed a regression where the `Device.openChannel()` return type
  had changed compared to before.
- **Fruity backend improvements**: Use Apple's CoreDeviceProxy as fallback, so
  we can support systems where NCM is problematic. Also retransmit mDNS-SD
  request every 250 ms, for added robustness.

Happy hacking!

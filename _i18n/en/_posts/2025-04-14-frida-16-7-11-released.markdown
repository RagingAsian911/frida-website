Quick bug-fix release bringing improvements to our Fruity backend, and basic
support for iOS 18.4:

- darwin: Update injector dyld init detection for iOS 18.4.

- fruity: Update injector dyld init detection for iOS 18.4 (#1154). Thanks to
  [@pachoo][] for this contribution.

- network-stack: Reduce delay between writes. By flagging as writable as
  soon as some space is available, without waiting for the low watermark.
  Thanks to [@mrmacete][] for this improvement.

- network-stack: Fix TCP write chunk length (#1156). Another fix by
  [@mrmacete][].

- network-stack: Always send enqueued data. This change ensures `pcb.output()`
  is called even when no more space is available on the queue, preventing stalls.
  Credits to [@mrmacete][] for preventing those pesky stalls.

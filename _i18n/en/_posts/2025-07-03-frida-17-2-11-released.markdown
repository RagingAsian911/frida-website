Just when we thought we had it all figured out, software reminded us how hard it
can be! Thanks to [@mrmacete][], [@hsorbo][], and [@0xmurphy][], we quickly
addressed the issues and present you with the following fixes:

- frida-node: Fix `fdn_keep_alive_until()` TSFN lifetime issue. We were setting
  the TSFN to `NULL`, which led to crashes when other reference-holders tried to
  schedule cleanup.

- fruity: Fix issue when killing prewarmed targets. Killing a prewarmed process
  at spawn time resulted in a "connection closed" error. This change catches the
  error so it's possible to spawn a fresh instance.
